  "description": "On the Task Board page, both the Edit and Move buttons on every task card are broken. Clicking 'Move' does nothing — the task stays in its current column. Clicking 'Edit' opens a prompt but it shows 'undefined' as the current title, and after entering a new title and confirming, the task title does not update. No errors appear in the console.",
  "expectedOutcome": "Clicking 'Move' should advance a task to the next status column (To Do → In Progress → Done → To Do). Clicking 'Edit' should open a prompt showing the current task title, and after entering a new title, the task title should update on the board.",
  "hint": "The task data renders correctly in each card, so the data itself is fine. The issue is in how the callback props are forwarded through the intermediate Column component. Check what shape of arguments the parent handlers in TaskBoard.jsx actually expect, versus what they're receiving.",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "bugFilePath": "src/components/taskboard/Column.jsx",
  "solution": "In Column.jsx, the developer added wrapper callbacks (handleMove and handleEdit) that transform the data flowing from TaskCard back to TaskBoard, breaking the expected argument shapes. handleMove wraps the numeric taskId in an object `{ taskId, fromStatus: status }` before passing it to onTaskMove. But handleTaskMove in TaskBoard.jsx expects a plain number — it does `prev.find((t) => t.id === taskId)` which fails because taskId is now an object. handleEdit extracts just `task.id` (a number) before passing it to onTaskEdit. But handleTaskEdit expects a full task object — it does `prompt('Edit task title:', task.title)` where task is now a number, so task.title is undefined. The fix is to either remove the wrapper callbacks and pass onTaskMove/onTaskEdit directly to TaskCard, or fix the wrappers to forward the arguments unchanged.",
  "solutionCode": "// Remove the handleMove and handleEdit wrappers, and pass callbacks directly:\n<TaskCard\n  key={task.id}\n  task={task}\n  onMove={onTaskMove}\n  onEdit={onTaskEdit}\n/>"
